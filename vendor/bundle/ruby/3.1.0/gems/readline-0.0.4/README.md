# Readline Loader

This is just a loader for "readline". If Ruby has the "readline-ext" gem
that is a native extension, this gem will load it. If Ruby does not have
the "readline-ext" gem this gem will load "reline", a library that is
compatible with the "readline-ext" gem and implemented in pure Ruby.
