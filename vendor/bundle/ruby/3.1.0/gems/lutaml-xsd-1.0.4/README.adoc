= Lutaml::Xsd

== Overview

**Lutaml::Xsd** is a *Ruby* gem designed to parse and build *XML Schema Definition (XSD)* objects. It provides a robust framework for handling *XSD* *elements*, *attributes*, and *complex types*, allowing users to manipulate and generate *XSD* objects programmatically.

== Installation

To install *Lutaml::Xsd*, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'lutaml-xsd'
----

And then execute:

[source,bash]
----
bundle install
----

Or install it by running:

[source,bash]
----
gem install lutaml-xsd
----

== Usage

=== Parsing XSD Files

To parse an *XSD* file, you can use the `Lutaml::Xsd.parse` method. This method takes the content of an *XSD* file as a string and optional parameters such as the location of the *XSD* file for resolving relative paths.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'lutaml/xsd'

xsd_content = File.read('path/to/your/schema.xsd')
parsed_schema = Lutaml::Xsd.parse(xsd_content, location: 'path/to/your/')
----

=== Working with Parsed Data

Once parsed, the data is represented as instances of various classes such as `Lutaml::Xsd::Schema`, `Lutaml::Xsd::Element`, and others. These objects reflect the structure of the *XSD* and can be manipulated or inspected in *Ruby*.

[source,ruby]
----
schema = <<~SCHEMA
<xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <xsd:element name="root">
    ...
  </xsd:element>
  <xsd:element name="root1">
    ...
  </xsd:element>
</xsd:schema>
SCHEMA

parsed_schema = Lutaml::Xsd.parse(schema, location: 'http://example.com/')

# Accessing elements of the schema
elements = parsed_schema.element
elements.each do |element|
  puts "Element Name: #{element.name}"
end
# the output will be:
> Element Name: root
> Element Name: root1
----

=== Serialization

The gem supports serializing the schema back to *XML*. Each class like `Lutaml::Xsd::Schema` has a method `to_xml` that generates the *XML* representation of the object.

[source,ruby]
----
xml_output = parsed_schema.to_xml
puts xml_output
----

== Key Components

=== Schema Representation

The *Lutaml::Xsd::Schema* class represents an *XSD* schema. It includes attributes for various schema properties like target namespace, element form default, and others.

- **Attributes and Elements**: The schema object contains collections of elements, complex types, simple types, etc., which are all accessible via attributes on the `Schema` object.

=== Include and Import Handling

The path provided in `location` via `Lutaml::Xsd.parse(schema, location: 'path/to/your/directory/')` is used for resolving relative paths provided in *include* and *import* element's *schemaLocation* attribute.

Make sure to provide the directory *path*/*URL* in `location` parameter, as it will be used as base path for resolving relative paths.

For example, if *URL* is provided:

[source,ruby]
----
Lutaml::Xsd.parse(xsd_content, location: 'http://example.com/directory/')
----

If local path is provided:

[source,ruby]
----
Lutaml::Xsd.parse(xsd_content, location: 'path/to/your/directory/')
----

[source, xml]
----
<xs:include schemaLocation="<location>/directory2/metaschema.xsd"/>
<!-- AND/OR -->
<xs:import schemaLocation="<location>/metaschema.xsd"/>
----

All schemas specified in the *include* and/or *import* elements will be fetched from their *schemaLocation*, parsed and added to their parent *Lutaml::Xsd::Schema* object.

== Development

- **Dependencies**: The gem depends on other gems like `zeitwerk` for autoloading and `lutaml-model` for model serialization. See the `Gemfile` and `lutaml-xsd.gemspec` for details on dependencies.

- **Testing**: Tests are written using RSpec. Test files and fixtures are located in the `spec` directory.

== About LutaML

The name "LutaML" is pronounced as "Looh-tah-mel".

The name "LutaML" comes from the Latin word for clay, "Lutum", and "ML"
for "Markup Language". Just as clay can be molded and modeled into beautiful and
practical end products, the Lutaml::Model gem is used for data modeling,
allowing you to shape and structure your data into useful forms.
